# Basic Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

***Aim of the Project:***
- Write contracts in Solidity
- Use OpenZeppelin library for generating smart contracts
- Minting an NFT
- Deploying the NFT on OpenSea's testing server using Rinkeby
